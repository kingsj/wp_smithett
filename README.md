WP Smithett
===========

**WP Smithett** is a mobile-first, responsive WordPress starter template made with Automattic's [Underscores](http://underscores.me) and Ben Smithett's [Style](https://github.com/bensmithett/style). It's named after [Ben](http://bensmithett.com/) because I stole all his work.

There's a live preview [here](http://wp-smithett.tombryan.co/).

Right now you'll need to have [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) installed, as well as some idea of how to use them. This will cost you some [Rubies](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [gems](http://rubygems.org/). Have Compass watch while you work inside the `stylesheets` directory — everything gets compiled into `style.css`. Don't look at me like that.

Oh — knowing about [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) is also really good.

### With WP Smithett you can...
* Make a website for your favourite client!
* Start a blog!
* (Probably) make a theme to sell on [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net)!
* Print it out to impress friends!
* And many more!

### Coming soon (maybe)
* A `Gemfile`
* Some actual instructions to help you get started
* Example modules and grid usage
