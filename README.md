WP Smithett
===========

**WP Smithett** is a mobile-first, responsive WordPress starter template made with Automattic's [Underscores](http://underscores.me) and Ben Smithett's [Style](https://github.com/bensmithett/style). It's named after [Ben](http://bensmithett.com/) because I stole all his work.

There's a live preview [here](http://wp-smithett.tombryan.co/).

You'll need to be somewhat familiar with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) to get the most out of WP Smithett. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is required for developing with this framework — if you're using a Mac though, it should Just Work™. 

Oh — knowing about [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) is also really good.

### Getting started
* Clone this repository or download the archive and put it in your `/wp-content/themes/` directory (don't forget to unzip it).
* Open a new Terminal window and: `$ cd wherever/you/put/it/wp-content/themes/wp_smithett`.
* All the dependencies are included in `Gemfile`, so go ahead and `$ gem install bundler && bundle install`.
* Use `$ compass watch` or `$ compass compile` while you work inside the `stylesheets` directory — everything gets compiled into `style.css`.
* Make something great!


### With WP Smithett you can...
* Make a website for your favourite client!
* Start a blog!
* (Probably) make a theme to sell on [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net)!
* Print it out to impress friends!
* And many more!
